This blog is about the many random things I'm learning and taking part in as a new developer. I quit my job as a Campaign Manager in December 2015 and started at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/)- a 14 week bootcamp in London. There I was exposed to a ton of amazing technologies, got to build real project with awesome, passionate people and within a month got my first job as a developer.

I'm joining [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) as a Graduate Software Developer, starting in the end of September 2016.
